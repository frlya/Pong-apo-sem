# APO_SEM

This program is a semestral project for the computer architectures course on CTU FEI in Prague.

Description
=============
This program is a simple video game that is very similar to Pong from 1972. In order to run this game, MicroZed APO hardware is required. (more to be added later)

Rules
=============
The game is designed for two players playing the game simultaneously. The game area is divided into two halves. Each of these halves contains a white vertical bar that can be controlled by one of the players. The bar on the left is controlled by the red knob, the bar on the right is controlled by the blue knob. Players control the bars in order to hit a ball that is flying through the game area at constant speed and bounces off everything that it hits. To make the game playable, two horizontal bars are added, one to the upper half of the game area, and one to the lower. If one of the players fails to hit the ball and the ball reaches the edge of the screen, the other player gets a point and the ball moves back to the center of the game area.

Additional information
=============
This project is still in development, so the game isn't fully operational yet.
